# Introduction

Provenance for Ocean

# Motivation

### What is provenance?

``` 
Provenance is information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness
```

Keen readers may wish to refer to a longer introduction [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/NOTE-prov-primer-20130430/#intuitive-overview-of-prov). We will first explain the key concepts of Prov and their equivalents in Ocean.

* Entities 
``` 
In PROV, physical, digital, conceptual, or other kinds of thing are called entities. Examples of such entities are a web page, a chart, and a spellchecker
```

* Agents
``` 
An agent takes a role in an activity such that the agent can be assigned some degree of responsibility for the activity taking place. An agent can be a person, a piece of software, an inanimate object, an organization, or other entities that may be ascribed responsibility. When an agent has some responsibility for an activity, PROV says the agent was associated with the activity, where several agents may be associated with an activity and vice-versa. 
```
* Activities
``` 
Activities are how entities come into existence and how their attributes change to become new entities, often making use of previously existing entities to achieve this. They are dynamic aspects of the world, such as actions, processes, etc. For example, if the second version of document D was generated by a translation from the first version of the document in another language, then this translation is an activity.
```


In the Ocean context

* Data Assets and Algorithms are entities. 
* Publishers, Consumers and Service Providers are agents.
* Publishing and invoking services are activities. 

In simple language, if we state that 

* "Bob user uploaded a dataset to Ocean", the prov version of it would be: "(Agent) Bob was associated with a publishing activity, which generated a (entity) data asset".
* "Bob ran a Consent service to filter a dataset", the prov version: "(Agent) Bob was associated with a filtering activity, which *used* an (entity) data asset and  generated a new (entity) data asset. The consent service (entity) was associate with (involved in) generating the asset".

# Use cases

Provenance information can be read from 3 perspectives:

* Agent centered : `what people or organizations were involved in generating or manipulating the data assets`
* Object centered : The origins of (portions of) a dataset from other datasets
* Process centered: Capturing the actions and steps taken to generate the data asset.

Example use cases:

* An model training algorithm (an entity in Prov) has been involved in generating several assets (e.g. trained models). Let's assume that a data scientist found a bug in the algorithm and fixed it. Provenance metadata can help us find the datasets generated by this algorithm, which need to be updated.
* The publisher of a data asset A1 (entity in prov) requires that all data assets that used A1, must pay licensing fees as a percentage of their selling price. Provenance metadata can help us find all the data assets that used data asset A1.
