# Assets Metadata Ontology

This OEP doesn't detail the exact method of registering ASSETS on-chain or publishing metadata in a metadata store.

Each Ocean Asset (dataset, algorithm, etc.) must have a base ontology associated with it.
This metadata, also called **DID descriptor objects (DDO)**, is stored in the OCEANDB and can be accessed using the **Decentralized ID (DID)**.
Assets without proper descriptive metadata can have poor visibility and discoverability.

The Asset ontology is based in the public schema.org [DataSet schema](https://schema.org/Dataset).


## Change Process

This document is governed by the [2/COSS](../2/README.md) (COSS).


## Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) \[[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)\] \[[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)\] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.


## Motivation

The main motivations of this OEP are:

* Specify the common attributes that HAVE to be added in any ASSET DDO stored in the system
* Normalize the attributes to use in any curation process, allowing to have a common structure to sort and filter the DDO's
* Identify the recommended additional attributes that SHOULD be included in a DDO to facilitate the ASSETS search
* Provide an example of a possible structured ASSET DDO and additional links for reference


## Base attributes

Base attributes are always part of the DDO schema. Those attributes could be mandatory if they need to be completed by the publisher or can be stored empty. The following attributes are included as part of the Asset Metadata:


| Attribute           | Type     | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              | Reference to Standard                                                               |

## Curation attributes

In order to normalize the different possible rating attributes after a process of curation, this is the normalize list of attributes to define:

----------------|---------------|---------------|----------------------
**rating**     | Number (decimal)       | Yes              | Decimal values between 0 and 1. 0 is the default value
**numVotes**    | Integer       | Yes              | Number of votes. 0 is the default value
**schema**      | Text          | No              | Schema applied to calculate the rating

Additional attributes are totally free to add and can be defined by the publisher of the DDO, in addition to the base attributes
