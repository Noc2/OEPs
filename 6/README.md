## Lightweight On-chain WMS (salpchain) <a name="salpchain"></a>

Ocean protocol works as a substrate for data consumption on blockchain, in which enables users to consume multiple 
services that could be on-chain or off-chain. Moreover theses services SHOULD preserve the privacy models such as zero-knowledge and 
at the same time provide some sort of service integrity such as verifiable computation. In this OEP, we are going to 
introduce a proposal for how to implement lightweight on-chain workflow management system [salpchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salp). 
Salpchain SHOULD enable users to execute workflows, orchestrate services, and manage tasks with minimal amount 
of gas on Ethereum blockchain.


## 1. Change Process <a name="change_process"></a>

This document is governed by the [2/COSS](../2/README.md) (COSS).

## 2. Language <a name="language"></a>
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", 
"NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in 
[BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) \[[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)\] 
\[[RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174)\] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, 
as shown here.

## 3. Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
As a data scientist, you have more complex problems. They might be not just about consuming datasets 
but also they might include different computation, storage and networking services. As a result, 
you will need to schedule these services in terms of workflow. Salpchain is an on-chain workflow 
management system in Ocean protocol that manages the scheduling and execution of workflows on Ethereum blockchain.
