# Ocean Protocol's Software Development Process

The original OEP 1/C4 was based on BigchainDB's [BEP-1](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/tree/master/1), which in turn was based on [C4, the Collective Code Construction Contract](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/).

Originally, the Ocean Protocol developers were intending to follow OEP 1/C4. However, over time, a different software development process developed and got used in practice. _That process_ is described in the [oceanprotocol/dev-ocean repository](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean).

OEP 1/C4 should be considered deleted to prevent confusion. If you want to read it, then [BEP-1](https://github.com/bigchaindb/BEPs/tree/master/1) is essentially the same.
